## Visual Style Guide

### Core Aesthetic (Joel Veitch / Rathergood)
- **Line quality**: Wobbly, hand-drawn look, slight wiggle even on "still" frames
- **Color palette**: Saturated, slightly garish, early-web feel
- **Animation fps**: Low (8-12 fps), intentionally choppy
- **Proportions**: Heads too big, bodies too small, limbs noodly
- **Backgrounds**: Simple gradients or tiled patterns, occasionally surreal landscapes
- **Lip sync**: Exaggerated open/close, 2-3 mouth shapes max
- **Movement**: Bounce-based, everything pulses to the beat

### Reference Videos
- "We Like the Moon" (Spongmonkeys)
- "Northern Kittens"
- "Herring"
- "Independent Woman" (kittens version)

### Jay Bhattacharya - Backup/Hype Man

**Role Options:**
- [ ] Backup singer (harmonizes, does "yeah!" ad-libs)
- [ ] Hype man (points at RFK, nods enthusiastically)
- [ ] Scientist observer (takes notes, looks concerned)
- [ ] DJ/beatbox (behind turntables or laptop)

**Visual Treatment:**
- Similar photo-cutout head approach
- Props: clipboard, laptop, Stanford mug

**Interaction Moments:**
- Looks at RFK with admiration
- Reacts to worm appearances
- Occasional knowing glance at camera

## Scene Ideas Bank

### Opening Options
1. Black screen -> worm tunnels through -> reveals scene
2. Medical scan aesthetic -> zoom into brain -> characters inside
3. C-SPAN parody -> boring hearing -> music kicks -> chaos
4. Petri dish under microscope -> zoom in -> worm world

### Verse Backdrops
1. Pulsing brain tissue (pink/gray gradient)
2. Intestinal landscape
3. Simple void with floating neurons
4. Karaoke bar aesthetic (lyrics on screen)

### Chorus Escalation
1. More worms appear each chorus
2. Background gets increasingly chaotic
3. Characters multiply (army of RFKs)
4. Reality starts glitching/breaking

### Bridge/Breakdown
1. Worm solo (tiny guitar/microphone)
2. Dramatic pause -> extreme close-up on worm
3. Mock-serious moment (black and white, rain)
4. Dance break with all characters

### Outro Options
1. Zoom out - it was all inside someone's head
2. Worm waves goodbye, tunnels away
3. Freeze frame with fake credits
4. Loop back to beginning seamlessly
