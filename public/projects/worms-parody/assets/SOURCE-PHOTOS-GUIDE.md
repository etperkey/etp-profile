### 4. Worm References

#### Real Earthworm Photos

- [Dreamstime - Earthworm Close Up](https://www.dreamstime.com/photos-images/earthworm-close-up.html) - 1,170 photos

**Key Features to Note:**
- Pink/gray coloring
- Segmented body

- Simple head end (no distinct face)

#### Dune Sandworm Reference
**For the giant baby-mouth worm:**
- [Dune Wiki - Sandworm](https://dune.fandom.com/wiki/Sandworm) - Detailed descriptions
- [Wikipedia - Sandworm (Dune)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandworm_(Dune)) - Design history

**Key Visual Notes:**
- Denis Villeneuve's version: mouth is ROUND (not tri-lobed)
- Mouth "80 meters in diameter" in the books
- Crystalline teeth around the rim
- Segmented body
- Emerges from below in dramatic fashion

**The Mashup Concept:**
Take the Dune worm body structure, but replace the mouth area with the baby mouth cutout. The baby teeth become the "crystalline teeth."

## Cutout Technique Guide

### How to Prepare Head Shots

1. **Remove Background**
   - Use [Remove.bg](https://remove.bg) for quick removal
   - Or manual selection in Photoshop/GIMP

2. **Separate the Jaw**
   - Draw selection line along upper lip / jaw line
   - Cut jaw as separate layer
   - The jaw will rotate/move for lip sync

3. **Optional: Separate Eyebrows**
   - For added expression
   - Cut as separate layers

4. **Export as PNG**
   - Transparent background
   - Save head, jaw, eyebrows as separate files

### File Naming Convention
```
/assets/heads/
├── rfk-head.png
├── rfk-jaw.png
├── rfk-eyebrows.png (optional)
├── jay-head.png
├── jay-jaw.png
└── baby-mouth.png (for Dune worm)
