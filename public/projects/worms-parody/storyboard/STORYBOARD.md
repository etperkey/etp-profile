| **Props** | Raw milk bottle beside RFK, vibrating with bass |
| **Background** | Pink/gray neural tissue, pulsing to beat |
| **Transition** | Background shifts to dirt tones as verse approaches |

**Animation Notes:**

| **Transition** | Hold on this composition, screen starts to wobble |

**Animation Notes:**
- This is THE line - give it visual weight
- Worm smug nod: simple rotation + slight vertical bob
- Consider: worm wearing tiny sunglasses for this moment?

---

### SCENE 3C: MUSICAL SAW + "They Gonna Eat You"
**Timestamp**: 0:57 - 1:06
**Duration**: 9 seconds
**Energy**: 3.5/5 (eerie interlude)

| Element | Description |

| **Jay** | Quick cut (1 second) to Jay nodding intensely, back to RFK |

**Duration**: 18 seconds

| **Worm** | Burrows through scene, popping up in different spots (whack-a-mole style) |
| **Jay** | Background, drumming steadily |
| **Transition** | Music shifts, prepare for hook 2 |

**Animation Notes:**

**Duration**: 5 seconds
**Energy**: 3/5 (brief rest)

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|

| **Mood** | Brief calm before hook returns |

---

### SCENE 5B: HOOK RETURNS
**Timestamp**: 1:31 - 1:36
**Duration**: 5 seconds
**Energy**: 4/5 (familiar peak)

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|

| **Lyrics** | "The same worms..." |
| **Escalation** | NOW THERE ARE 2 WORMS flanking RFK |
| **Action** | Both worms nod in unison |

---

### SCENE 5C: WOODWINDS JOIN - THE WORM ORCHESTRA
**Timestamp**: 1:36 - 1:57
**Duration**: 21 seconds
**Energy**: 3.5/5 (layering complexity)

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Frame** | Wider shot, scene gets busier - THE WORM ORCHESTRA REVEALED |
| **Audio Cue** | Woodwind instruments join the mix |
| **THE WORM BAND** | Worms are playing ALL the instruments: |
| | - One worm on clarinet (holding it vertically, blowing into it) |
| | - One worm on flute (horizontal, tiny worm arms) |
| | - Original saw worm still sawing away |
| | - Maybe a worm on oboe for extra absurdity |
| **Layout** | Worms arranged like a tiny orchestra pit below RFK |
| **Worm Escalation** | More worms join as section progresses - it's a FULL WORM BAND |
| **RFK** | Grooving, occasionally glancing down at his worm orchestra with pride |
| **Jay** | Still drumming in background, but the WORMS are the real musicians now |
| **Transition** | Orchestra builds toward verse 3 |

**Animation Notes:**
- Each worm-instrument combo: simple 2-frame "playing" animation loop
- Clarinet worm: body puffs up slightly on each note
- Flute worm: slight sway side-to-side
- This establishes that the WORMS are the source of the music
- Jay is just backup now - the worms run the show

---

## ACT 3: ESCALATION & CLIMAX (1:57 - 3:15)

---

### SCENE 6: VERSE 3 - "I Had A Dream..."
**Timestamp**: 1:57 - 2:12
**Duration**: 15 seconds
**Energy**: 4/5 (building intensity)

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Frame** | Dream sequence aesthetic - softer colors, wavy edges, vignette |
| **Lyrics** | "I had a dream I was under the ground / Friends and family buried all around" |
| **RFK** | More intense expression than verse 1, same lyrics but higher stakes |
| **Visual Filter** | Edges ripple like water, dreamy blur effect |
| **JAY GAG** | (2:05) "Friends and family" - Jay appears as one of the buried, still drumming underground, only his arms visible above dirt |
| **Worm** | Has grown slightly larger, more confident posture |
| **Transition** | Dream edges start glitching, colors destabilizing |

**Animation Notes:**
- Dream effect: slight wave distortion on edges
- Jay underground: just arms + drumsticks poking out, drumming
- Worm size: scale up 120% from original

---

### SCENE 7: BRIDGE/BREAKDOWN - THE DUNE WORM SCREAM
**Timestamp**: 2:12 - 2:21
**Duration**: 9 seconds
**Energy**: 5/5 (MAXIMUM CHAOS / BODY HORROR)

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Frame** | Build to the DUNE MOMENT |
| **Audio Cue** | Crazy musical effect in the track |
| **THE CONCEPT** | A MASSIVE DUNE-STYLE SANDWORM emerges - but with CUTOUT BABY MOUTH AND TEETH |

**SEQUENCE:**

| Time | Visual | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| 2:12-2:14 | Quick cuts: colors invert, screen glitches, RFK looks alarmed | Building dread |
| 2:14-2:15 | Ground/background starts to RUMBLE and crack | Something is coming |
| 2:15-2:19 | **THE DUNE WORM EMERGES** | |
| | - MASSIVE worm bursts up from below like Shai-Hulud | |
| | - But its mouth is a CUTOUT OF A BABY'S MOUTH | |
| | - With REAL BABY TEETH visible | |
| | - The baby mouth OPENS WIDE and SCREAMS | |
| | - The scream syncs to the crazy musical effect | |
| | - RFK and Jay are TINY in comparison | |
| 2:19-2:21 | Dune worm ROARS at camera, baby teeth fully visible, then SLAMS back down | Punctuation |

**THE BABY MOUTH WORM:**
- Body: Massive pink/gray worm, Dune-style segmented
- Mouth: Photo cutout of baby's open mouth, oversized
- Teeth: Real baby teeth visible, slightly off-putting
- Scale: HUGE - takes up 80% of frame when emerged
- Sound sync: The "scream" is the weird musical effect

**Animation Notes:**
- Emergence: Burst up from bottom of frame
- Baby mouth: Opens progressively wider (3-4 mouth open states)
- The horror is the uncanny valley of baby features on monster body
- This is the NIGHTMARE moment - absurd body horror
- Reference: Dune sandworm emergence shots
- Reference: Aphex Twin "Windowlicker" style face-swap horror

**Why it works:**
- Unexpected escalation from cute cartoon worms to ELDRITCH BABY WORM
- The musical effect NEEDS a visual that matches its weirdness
- Baby teeth = deeply unsettling but also hilarious
- Pays off the "brain worm" premise with actual nightmare fuel

---

### SCENE 8A: CLIMAX - FULL CHAOS SUSTAINED (Post-Dune Worm)
**Timestamp**: 2:21 - 3:07
**Duration**: 46 seconds
**Energy**: 5/5 (sustained peak)

|---------|-------------|
| **Frame** | Everything from before, layered together - POST DUNE WORM EMERGENCE |
| **Aftermath** | The ground is cracked from where the Dune worm emerged |
| **Background** | NOW FULL OF WORMS - they're everywhere, writhing, the worms have WON |
| **RFK** | Maximum energy lip-sync, head bouncing hard, seems unfazed by giant worm |
| **Jay** | Drumming intensely, dirt on him from the emergence |
| **WORM ORCHESTRA** | Full worm band in the foreground - saw, clarinet, flute, oboe all playing |
| **Worm Army** | Dozens of backup worms, all vibing, some conducting |
| **Escalation Beats** | |
| | - (2:25) Worm orchestra playing in full swing |
| | - (2:30) Raw milk cartons multiply, float through scene |

| **Gag** | (2:45) Worm literally nibbles on animated hair strands on RFK's head |
| **Optional** | (2:55) Dune worm briefly visible in background, watching approvingly |
| **Transition** | Energy sustains until 3:07 |

**Animation Notes:**
- This is the longest sustained section
- Use looping animations to fill time
- The WORM ORCHESTRA is now the featured band
- Add new worms spawning from ground cracks every 10-15 seconds
- Worm hair-nibble: simple chomp animation on hair strands
- The vibe: RFK has accepted his role as host to the worm civilization

---

### SCENE 8B: FINAL REFRAIN
**Timestamp**: 3:07 - 3:15
**Duration**: 8 seconds
**Energy**: 4.5/5 (climax resolution)

| **Action** | RFK delivers with gravitas, everything else FREEZES momentarily |
| **Worm Moment** | Worm and RFK share a knowing look - mutual respect |
| **Mood** | Absurd but weirdly profound - the joke lands |
| **Transition** | Hold beat, then energy drops for outro |

**Animation Notes:**
- Freeze frame effect: everything stops except RFK's mouth
- The "look" between RFK and worm: both turn slightly toward each other
- Hold this composition for emotional beat

---

## ACT 4: RESOLUTION (3:15 - 3:27)

---

### SCENE 9: OUTRO - FADE DOWN
**Timestamp**: 3:15 - 3:27
**Duration**: 12 seconds
**Energy**: 2/5 -> 0/5 (fading)

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Frame** | Gradual simplification, elements fade away |
| **Audio** | Breathing + slow drum beat |
| **Visual** | Colors desaturate over 12 seconds |
| **RFK** | Bouncing slows, eventually stops, slight knowing smile |
| **Jay** | Drumming becomes sparse, fades to silhouette, disappears |
| **Worms** | All worms gradually leave except THE original worm |
| **Final Worm Beat** | (3:20) Worm waves goodbye to camera |
| **Worm Exit** | (3:22) Worm burrows back into RFK's ear |
| **Final Shot** | (3:24-3:27) RFK alone, still, breathing sound continues |
| **End Card** | Fade to black. Text: "THE END" (rathergood font style) |
| **Optional** | Tiny worm pokes out one more time on "THE END" text, then hides |

**Animation Notes:**
- Desaturation: gradual over 12 seconds (100% -> 20% saturation)
- Wave goodbye: classic beauty-queen wave, 2-second hold
- Final worm poke on END card: quick gag, 1 second
